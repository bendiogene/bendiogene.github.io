abstract = {One of the limits of web content discovery tools, let them be recommender systems or content curation tools such as social rating, social bookmarking and other social media, is the scarcity of user input (e.g. rate, submit, share). This problem is even worse in the case of what we call communities of a place: people who study, live or work at the same place. Such people often share common interests but either do not know each other or fail to actively engage in submitting and relaying information. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using the aggregated clicks of entire communities of users to passively emulate a content curation service a la Reddit. To this end, we prototype and deploy WeBrowse, a content curation service based on the processing of raw HTTP logs. Evaluation based on our deployments demonstrates feasibility at scale while respecting user privacy. The majority of WeBrowse's users welcome the quality of content it promotes.},

abstract = {Understanding how people interact with the web is key for a variety of applications, e.g., from the design of effective web pages to the definition of successful online marketing campaigns. Browsing behavior has been traditionally represented and studied by means of clickstreams, i.e., graphs whose vertices are web pages, and edges are the paths followed by users. Obtaining large and representative data to extract clickstreams is, however, challenging.The evolution of the web questions whether browsing behavior is changing and, by consequence, whether properties of clickstreams are changing. This article presents a longitudinal study of clickstreams from 2013 to 2016. We evaluate an anonymized dataset of HTTP traces captured in a large ISP, where thousands of households are connected. We first propose a methodology to identify actual URLs requested by users from the massive set of requests automatically fired by browsers when rendering web pages. Then, we characterize web usage patterns and clickstreams, taking into account both the temporal evolution and the impact of the device used to explore the web. Our analyses precisely quantify various aspects of clickstreams and uncover interesting patterns, such as the typical short paths followed by people while navigating the web, the fast increasing trend in browsing from mobile devices, and the different roles of search engines and social networks in promoting content.Finally, we contribute a dataset of anonymized clickstreams to the community to foster new studies.<sup;>1</sup;>},
